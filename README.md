> The project consists of parsing ana anlysing an DFA with a given structure. The main purpose was to estamblish a vliad relationship between flex and Java and to prove that any specific dfa from tests has its unique characteristics like a precise set of accessible states, productive states and even a finiste languge proved by a mapping to a directed Graph.

The homework is made at the Politehnica University of Bucharest and has not been presented to public, as a reason I did't make the pdf piblic and so the checker and tests. Here is just an implementation and it can be a very good starter for any flex and Java basic project.
