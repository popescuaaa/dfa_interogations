II. Design
----------
A. Program design

1. Style
The whole problem was constructed on a directed graph structure and basically
all checks were automatically mapped to classical operations of directed graphs.

2. Problems!!!!!
On the local machine all tests, bonus test included perform very well and on tine,
but on checker I can barely get over 110 points because of timeouts. This this is not
normal at all as the problem in essence is to give the good result not the best efficient
one, of course after my perspective.

3. Implementation
As described in the comments for the basic check -e I just verify if the initial state
is final too; for the -a option I just walk dfs style on the graph as see the pattern of
accessible states; for the -u I perform another dfs with a special case of stopping
in which any final state is a valid one for the walk; for the -v is a combination of calls
of those functions enumerated above and of course all there combined with checks of the two
main boolean conditions, I say two as the third one is found in the first one and for the bonus
part I check weather the graph is a dag and if not, check if the discovery time of util states
are less than their neighbours as this condition is sufficient to prove the fact that there is
a cycle with util states.

4. Conclusion:
This was cool homework but I am very upset of the fact that I worked so hard for it
thinking about the late date of posted and the great amount of final examinations from this
period.
